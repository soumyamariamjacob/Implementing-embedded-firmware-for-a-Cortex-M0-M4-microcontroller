1. Overview

The Automated Emergency Braking System (AEBS) is designed to enhance vehicle safety by automatically applying the brakes when an imminent collision is detected. This system leverages radar or LIDAR sensors to continuously monitor the vehicle's surroundings for obstacles. If the system identifies a potential collision, it activates the braking actuator to reduce the vehicle’s speed or stop it entirely, thereby preventing or mitigating the impact of an accident.

2. Components Required

Radar or LIDAR Sensor:

Radar Sensor (e.g., Bosch SRR): Detects obstacles and measures their distance and speed.

LIDAR Sensor (e.g., Velodyne VLP-16): Provides high-resolution distance measurements and obstacle detection.

Microcontroller:

Arduino, STM32, or Raspberry Pi: For processing sensor data and controlling the braking actuator.

Braking Actuator:

Electronic Braking Actuator (e.g., hydraulic or pneumatic actuator): Interfaces with the vehicle’s braking system to apply brakes.

Safety and Control System:

Relay Module: To control high-current braking actuators.

Override Control Mechanism: To allow manual braking if necessary.

Power Supply:

12V Vehicle Power Supply or Battery Pack: To power the sensors, microcontroller, and actuators.

Miscellaneous:

Jumper wires, resistors, and connectors: For wiring and connections.

Enclosure: To protect the electronics and sensors.

3. System Architecture

The AEBS consists of several interconnected components:

Obstacle Detection:

Radar or LIDAR sensors continuously scan the vehicle’s surroundings, detecting obstacles and measuring their distance and relative speed.

Data Processing:

The microcontroller processes the data from the sensors to determine if a collision is imminent. This involves calculating the time to collision (TTC) based on the distance and speed of approaching obstacles.

Braking Activation:

When an imminent collision is detected, the microcontroller sends a signal to the braking actuator to apply the brakes. The system must ensure that braking occurs smoothly and effectively to avoid jerky movements.

Integration with Existing Braking Systems:

The AEBS integrates with the vehicle’s existing braking system, allowing for override control if the driver manually engages the brakes. The system must ensure that it does not interfere with normal braking operations.

Safety and Override:

The system includes a manual override feature, allowing the driver to take control of braking if needed. Safety mechanisms ensure that the automated braking does not engage inappropriately.

Creating a basic prototype of an Automated Emergency Braking System (AEBS) involves integrating sensors, a microcontroller, and a braking actuator. Here’s a simplified example of source code using an Arduino microcontroller, a generic radar sensor, and a braking actuator. This example assumes that the radar sensor provides a distance measurement and that the braking actuator can be controlled by a digital output pin.

Components and Connections

Radar Sensor: Measures distance to obstacles and communicates via analog output or serial data.

Microcontroller (Arduino): Processes the sensor data and controls the braking actuator.

Braking Actuator: Activated by a digital pin to apply the brakes.

Explanation

Pin Definitions:

radarPin is connected to the analog output of the radar sensor.

brakePin controls the braking actuator.

Setup Function:

Initializes serial communication for debugging.

Sets the brakePin as an output and ensures the brakes are initially off.

Loop Function:

Reads the sensor value from the radar and converts it to distance. The conversion factor (5.0 / 1023.0) * 100.0 is an example and depends on the sensor’s specific characteristics.

Prints the distance to the serial monitor for debugging.

Checks if the distance is below the collisionThreshold. If it is, the system activates the brakes by setting brakePin to HIGH. Otherwise, it keeps the brakes off by setting brakePin to LOW.

Includes a small delay for stability.

Notes

Sensor Calibration: The conversion from the sensor reading to distance might need calibration based on the specific sensor's data sheet and characteristics.

Braking Actuator Control: The method to control the braking actuator depends on its type. For a simple actuator, a digital pin might suffice, but more complex systems might require PWM or other control methods.

Safety: This code is a basic example. In a real-world application, additional safety checks, error handling, and testing are crucial. The system should be thoroughly tested to ensure reliable operation under various conditions.

This code serves as a starting point for developing an AEBS. For a production system, you would need more robust algorithms, fail-safes, and integration with other vehicle systems.
